Issues
------

1. In some browsers, like Microsoft Edge, directly opening the index.html files of our games from the file system may result in a failure to run
	
	a) Identified reason is the usage of the sessionStorage

	b) Cure is to open our games through some web servers, like Apache; we have tested with xampp; it works in all browsers

	c) Directly opening the index.html file works in Chrome

2. Some random issues with networking.
